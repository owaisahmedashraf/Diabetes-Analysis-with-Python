# Diabetes Analysis with Python

## About the Project
A data analysis project using Python's NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries to analyze a diabetes dataset. The project includes data cleaning, manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization to uncover key insights that may assist in understanding diabetes-related factors.


### Techniques Used
- **NumPy:** Used for statistical analysis and array operations.
- **Pandas:** Employed for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib:** Utilized for creating a variety of visualizations to explore data relationships.

## Project Accomplishments
- Successfully identified key statistical insights into factors affecting diabetes.
- Developed visualizations to represent the data effectively, aiding in quicker comprehension and analysis.
- Created a predictive model to understand the likelihood of diabetes based on several diagnostic measures.

## Files
- `Python Project 3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis workflow.
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` file.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.
